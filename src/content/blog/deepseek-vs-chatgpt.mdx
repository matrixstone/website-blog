On January 20, 2025, DeepSeek launched its landmark model, **DeepSeek-R1**, which quickly propelled 
the company to the top of **the U.S. iOS Apple Store as the most downloaded free app**. 
This release also triggered a notable downturn in U.S. financial stock markets.

Artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a breathtaking rate, with new breakthroughs 
appearing almost daily. For a long time, ChatGPT has maintained its leadership 
in AI-driven conversation, known for its expansive knowledge base and remarkably 
human-like interactions. Yet, DeepSeek's introduction of the DeepSeek-R1 model has shaken 
the industry, posing a serious challenge to ChatGPT's longstanding dominance.

## Summary of Deepseek

[​DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) is a Chinese artificial intelligence startup founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, 
co-founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer Capital. Headquartered in Hangzhou, the company specializes in developing 
open-source large language models (LLMs) that are both cost-effective and highly efficient.​

In January 2025, DeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, which was trained for 
**approximately $6 million using Nvidia H800 chips—significantly less than the over $100 million reportedly 
spent on training models like OpenAI's GPT-4**. Despite its lower training costs, DeepSeek-R1 **
achieved performance levels comparable to leading AI models**, particularly in tasks requiring 
mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. 

DeepSeek AI's open-source approach, releasing its models under the permissive MIT License, 
has garnered attention for promoting transparency and collaboration in AI development. 
The company's success has been viewed as a significant moment in the global AI landscape, 
challenging the dominance of U.S.-based AI firms and highlighting China's growing capabilities in the field.​

## Summary of ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) is a conversational AI developed by OpenAI, launched in November 2022, designed to understand 
and generate human-like text based on user prompts. Built on advanced large language models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o, 
ChatGPT has become a leading platform for tasks ranging from casual conversation to complex problem-solving, 
coding, writing, and professional support. Its strength lies in its vast knowledge base, 
natural interaction style, and ability to adapt to a wide range of topics. 
Since its launch, ChatGPT has helped popularize AI in everyday life, 
setting the standard for AI-driven communication.

Over the past two years, ChatGPT has undergone multiple updates. 
It allows users to select different GPT models, with the latest 
being GPT-4o. Additionally, it supports features such as web search, 
reasoning, and the inclusion of additional documents/images. 


## DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT: Feature Comparison

### Model Architecture

The two AI models use different operating methods. DeepSeek uses a mixture of experts (MoE) approach, in which only the most relevant experts handle each task. This approach improves efficiency by activating only a portion of the billions of parameters per request, thereby optimizing performance and resource consumption.

On the other hand, ChatGPT uses a standard Transformer model architecture where all parameters participate in every task. This ensures consistency but may be less efficient than DeepSeek's adaptive MoE strategy.

### Performance Capabilities

Each model has its own strengths in different fields. DeepSeek excels in technical fields (especially mathematical calculations and problem solving), achieving an accuracy rate of 90% . This makes it very efficient in solving complex problems.

In contrast, ChatGPT provides superior contextual understanding capabilities. The responses it generates are more detailed and comprehensive, and have advantages in general conversations and creative tasks.

### Diversity of application scenarios

DeepSeek's technical accuracy and expert model hybrid approach make it show great potential in data analysis, programming and academic research, especially in the fields of mathematics and structured problem solving. It can also support report generation, workflow automation and financial automation.

ChatGPT is widely used in many fields due to its strong adaptability, including customer support, content creation, education, programming assistance, etc. This diverse function makes ChatGPT extremely valuable for both personal and professional needs.

### Target Users

Both DeepSeek and ChatGPT are suitable for different types of users. However, DeepSeek's target users are mainly developers, business teams, and scientific researchers who need efficient AI-driven solutions. In early 2025, DeepSeek's growing user base proved its appeal as an economical alternative to traditional AI solutions, attracting users who are looking for cost-effective and high-performance AI tools.

ChatGPT serves a wider range of users, including individual users, corporate teams, educators and students. Its contextual awareness and human-like response make it the first choice in many fields.

### DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT

DeepSeek R1 is the latest open source model released and has become a hot topic in the technology community. It is a powerful reasoning model that can solve tasks that require advanced reasoning and deep problem analysis. ChatGPT is more like a general AI robot with multiple uses.

**Some key differences between DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT are as follows**:

- Research and Innovation: DeepSeek R1 supports experimental AI applications in academic institutions, while ChatGPT follows a commercial development cycle.
- Ecosystem transparency: DeepSeek R1 is an open source model committed to community contributions, while ChatGPT adopts a proprietary and closed source model.
- Programming ability: DeepSeek R1 excels at programming debugging, while ChatGPT excels in code generation and explanation.
- Image generation: DeepSeek R1 cannot generate images directly, while ChatGPT supports direct image generation based on DALL-E.
- Domain expertise: DeepSeek R1’s expert model hybrid design enhances technical query responses, while ChatGPT provides more general output.
- Creative Writing: DeepSeek R1 focuses more on factual and analytical content writing, while ChatGPT prefers creative content such as narrative and poetry.
- Deployment flexibility: DeepSeek R1 supports highly customizable local deployment, while ChatGPT mainly relies on cloud services.
- Customizability: DeepSeek R1 offers rich configuration options, while ChatGPT provides standardized responses.
- Data privacy: DeepSeek R1 emphasizes transparency in data processing, while ChatGPT adopts a centralized security model.

In short, DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT are both conversational AI platforms, but they differ significantly in terms of architecture and target applications.
