On January 20, 2025, DeepSeek launched its landmark model, **DeepSeek-R1**, which quickly propelled 
the company to the top of **the U.S. iOS Apple Store as the most downloaded free app**. 
This release also triggered a notable downturn in U.S. financial stock markets.

Artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a breathtaking rate, with new breakthroughs 
appearing almost daily. For a long time, ChatGPT has maintained its leadership 
in AI-driven conversation, known for its expansive knowledge base and remarkably 
human-like interactions. Yet, DeepSeek's introduction of the DeepSeek-R1 model has shaken 
the industry, posing a serious challenge to ChatGPT's longstanding dominance.

## What is Deepseek?

[â€‹DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) is a Chinese artificial intelligence startup founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, 
co-founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer Capital. Headquartered in Hangzhou, the company specializes in developing 
open-source large language models (LLMs) that are both cost-effective and highly efficient.â€‹

In January 2025, DeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, which was trained for 
**approximately $6 million using Nvidia H800 chipsâ€”significantly less than the over $100 million reportedly 
spent on training models like OpenAI's GPT-4**. Despite its lower training costs, DeepSeek-R1 **
achieved performance levels comparable to leading AI models**, particularly in tasks requiring 
mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. 

DeepSeek AI's open-source approach, releasing its models under the permissive MIT License, 
has garnered attention for promoting transparency and collaboration in AI development. 
The company's success has been viewed as a significant moment in the global AI landscape, 
challenging the dominance of U.S.-based AI firms and highlighting China's growing capabilities in the field.â€‹

## Summary of ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) is a conversational AI developed by OpenAI, launched in November 2022, designed to understand 
and generate human-like text based on user prompts. Built on advanced large language models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o, 
ChatGPT has become a leading platform for tasks ranging from casual conversation to complex problem-solving, 
coding, writing, and professional support. Its strength lies in its vast knowledge base, 
natural interaction style, and ability to adapt to a wide range of topics. 
Since its launch, ChatGPT has helped popularize AI in everyday life, 
setting the standard for AI-driven communication.

Over the past two years, ChatGPT has undergone multiple updates. 
It allows users to select different GPT models, with the latest 
being GPT-4o. Additionally, it supports features such as web search, 
reasoning, and the inclusion of additional documents/images.

### Performance Testing

DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates strong performance, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning and problem-solving. Its Mixture-of-Experts architecture enables it to activate only a small subset of parameters for each task, making it highly efficient compared to traditional dense models. Trained at a fraction of the cost of competitors, DeepSeek-R1 is optimized for technical fields like mathematics, coding, and structured analysis.

In comparison, ChatGPT-4o excels in versatility and natural language capabilities. It delivers more nuanced, creative, and contextually rich responses across a broader range of topics. Although ChatGPT-4o requires significantly higher computational resources and cost to train, it remains the leader in general-purpose AI interactions.

Overall, DeepSeek-R1 stands out for efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and technical accuracy, while ChatGPT-4o maintains an edge in conversational quality, adaptability, and creativity.
