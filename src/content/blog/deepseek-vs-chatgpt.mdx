On January 20, 2025, DeepSeek released its most iconic model, "DeepSeek-R1." This made DeepSeek the most downloaded free app on the U.S. iOS Apple Store and led to a significant decline in the U.S. financial markets.

The field of artificial intelligence is advancing at an astonishing pace, with new technologies emerging every other day. ChatGPT, with its vast knowledge and exceptional human-like interaction capabilities, has consistently been a leader in the AI conversation domain. However, DeepSeek's latest release, the DeepSeek-R1 model, has disrupted the status quo of the AI industry, challenging ChatGPT's dominant position.

## Summary of Deepseek

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup that has developed a series of open-source large language models (LLMs) capable of competing with advanced AI systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. The company has released several open-source models, including DeepSeek-V1, DeepSeek-V2, and the latest DeepSeek-V3.

DeepSeek AI is designed to provide high-performance natural language processing (NLP) capabilities for various application scenarios. However, the release of the R1 inference model instantly drew global attention to the company.

DeepSeek emphasizes a spirit of openness and collaboration, empowering developers and researchers worldwide to build and innovate upon its technology by open-sourcing its models.

## Summary of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, launched in November 2022. It is a chatbot interface that provides access to a range of models. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, it simulates human conversation and performs various tasks related to content writing, coding, reviewing, and more.

Over the past two years, ChatGPT has undergone multiple updates. It allows users to select different GPT models, with the latest being GPT-4o. Additionally, it supports features such as web search, reasoning, and the inclusion of additional documents/images. In short, ChatGPT has become a versatile AI assistant suitable for users across various industries.



## DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT: Feature Comparison

### Model Architecture

The two AI models use different operating methods. DeepSeek uses a mixture of experts (MoE) approach, in which only the most relevant experts handle each task. This approach improves efficiency by activating only a portion of the billions of parameters per request, thereby optimizing performance and resource consumption.

On the other hand, ChatGPT uses a standard Transformer model architecture where all parameters participate in every task. This ensures consistency but may be less efficient than DeepSeek's adaptive MoE strategy.

### Performance Capabilities

Each model has its own strengths in different fields. DeepSeek excels in technical fields (especially mathematical calculations and problem solving), achieving an accuracy rate of 90% . This makes it very efficient in solving complex problems.

In contrast, ChatGPT provides superior contextual understanding capabilities. The responses it generates are more detailed and comprehensive, and have advantages in general conversations and creative tasks.

### Diversity of application scenarios

DeepSeek's technical accuracy and expert model hybrid approach make it show great potential in data analysis, programming and academic research, especially in the fields of mathematics and structured problem solving. It can also support report generation, workflow automation and financial automation.

ChatGPT is widely used in many fields due to its strong adaptability, including customer support, content creation, education, programming assistance, etc. This diverse function makes ChatGPT extremely valuable for both personal and professional needs.

### Target Users

Both DeepSeek and ChatGPT are suitable for different types of users. However, DeepSeek's target users are mainly developers, business teams, and scientific researchers who need efficient AI-driven solutions. In early 2025, DeepSeek's growing user base proved its appeal as an economical alternative to traditional AI solutions, attracting users who are looking for cost-effective and high-performance AI tools.

ChatGPT serves a wider range of users, including individual users, corporate teams, educators and students. Its contextual awareness and human-like response make it the first choice in many fields.

### DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT

DeepSeek R1 is the latest open source model released and has become a hot topic in the technology community. It is a powerful reasoning model that can solve tasks that require advanced reasoning and deep problem analysis. ChatGPT is more like a general AI robot with multiple uses.

**Some key differences between DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT are as follows**:

- Research and Innovation: DeepSeek R1 supports experimental AI applications in academic institutions, while ChatGPT follows a commercial development cycle.
- Ecosystem transparency: DeepSeek R1 is an open source model committed to community contributions, while ChatGPT adopts a proprietary and closed source model.
- Programming ability: DeepSeek R1 excels at programming debugging, while ChatGPT excels in code generation and explanation.
- Image generation: DeepSeek R1 cannot generate images directly, while ChatGPT supports direct image generation based on DALL-E.
- Domain expertise: DeepSeek R1â€™s expert model hybrid design enhances technical query responses, while ChatGPT provides more general output.
- Creative Writing: DeepSeek R1 focuses more on factual and analytical content writing, while ChatGPT prefers creative content such as narrative and poetry.
- Deployment flexibility: DeepSeek R1 supports highly customizable local deployment, while ChatGPT mainly relies on cloud services.
- Customizability: DeepSeek R1 offers rich configuration options, while ChatGPT provides standardized responses.
- Data privacy: DeepSeek R1 emphasizes transparency in data processing, while ChatGPT adopts a centralized security model.

In short, DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT are both conversational AI platforms, but they differ significantly in terms of architecture and target applications.
