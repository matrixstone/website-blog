## Deepseek Open Platform

At same time you can access deepseek through Deepseek open platform.


## 🔐 Step 1: Get an API Key

1. Go to the [DeepSeek Open Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com).
2. Sign up or log in.
3. Navigate to **"API Keys"** from the sidebar.
4. Click **"Create API Key"**, name it if desired, and **copy** the key securely.
   > ⚠️ You’ll only see the key once, so make sure to store it safely.

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Set Up Authentication

Use Bearer Token authentication in your HTTP headers:

- HTTP Header:
  ```http
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

- API Endpoint:

  ```
  https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions
  ```
Ensure you include the Authorization header in all your API requests

## 🧠Step 3: Choose a Model

DeepSeek offers two primary models:​

- deepseek-chat (V3): A general-purpose model trained on extensive text data, suitable for a wide range of tasks.

- deepseek-reasoner (R1): Optimized for advanced reasoning, mathematics, and coding tasks. ​

Specify your chosen model in the model parameter of your API request.​

## 💻 Step 4: Make an API Call (Python Example)
Here's how to make a basic API call using Python:
```import requests

url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, DeepSeek!"}]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## 🧪 Step 5: Test with Tools like Apidog
For testing and debugging, you can use tools like Apidog:​

1. Install Apidog and create a new API request.

2. Set the HTTP method to POST.

3. Enter the API endpoint: https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions.

4. Configure headers:

   1. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

   2. Content-Type: application/json

5. Add the request body in JSON format:
```
{
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, DeepSeek!"}]
}
```
6. Send the request and observe the response.
